Hello my name is Zachary Payne

I am a Graduate Research Scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington with a focus on understanding the place heterogeneous reactions have in the speciation and concentration of 
gaseous reactive nitrogen oxides in the lower troposphere. As an analytical chemist I have had to dig deep into realm of computer programming, be it for developing a protocol to 
run my sampling and measurement routines, treating data with R to understand the underlying mechanisms driving reactions, or creating an application to visualize and share my work.
Software development has been just as, if not more so, important as benchwork in my graduate career.

My proficiences for the following languages include:

R - Expert
Rshiny - Expert
DaqFactory - Proficient
Python - Proficient
PacControlBasic - Proficient
HTML/HTML5/CSS - Proficient
Java - Proficient
Igor - Competent
VisualBasic - Competent
OriginLabTalk - Competent
